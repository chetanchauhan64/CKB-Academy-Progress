**Date:** 2nd – 8th Dec, 2025

### Tasks Completed

### Project Setup – Decentralized Blog Platform Using CKBFS

Started working on my main project: a decentralized WordPress-style blog publishing platform using CKBFS for storage.

#### Progress & Implementation

- Created a new project directory at the root of the CKB Academy repository.
- Set up the development workspace using VS Code.
- Structured the project for scalable development by creating core folders:

  - `contracts` – smart contract logic
  - `frontend` – user interface
  - `scripts` – helper scripts
  - `assets` – static files and resources

- Initialized the project configuration and verified the setup using the VS Code terminal.
- Prepared the environment for upcoming CKBFS integration and on-chain/off-chain data handling.

#### Key Learnings

- How to properly organize a main project inside the CKB Builder Academy repository.
- Best practices for initial project setup before starting core development.
