// Welcome to your first Rust exercise!
//
// The goal here is simple: get familiar with the println! macro.
// You can use println! to print messages or variables to the console.
//
// Try editing the text below or adding new lines to see how it works.

fn main() {
    println!("Welcome to the Rust Learning Track!");
    println!("This is your first program written in Rust.");
    
    let learner_name = "Chetan";
    let week = 4;
    println!("Hi {}, you're currently on week {} of your Rust journey!", learner_name, week);

    println!("\nRemember:");
    println!("- Rust emphasizes safety and ownership.");
    println!("- Youâ€™ll explore variables, functions, and memory management soon.");
    println!("- Keep experimenting and running your code often!");

    println!("\nTip: Modify any println! or variable and rerun to see instant changes!");
