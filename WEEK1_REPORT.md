Courses Completed 

• Completed the first half of Lesson 1 from the CKB Academy:

  ◦Introduction & Theory (How CKB Works as a Chain of Cells):

  ◦ Studied how CKB uses the Cell Model, where every cell represents a unit of state on the blockchain.
  ◦ Understood the relation between CKB’s cell chain and Bitcoin’s UTXO model, with greater flexibility for smart contract logic.

  ■ Cell Structure:

   ◦ Learned the four core components: `capacity`, `lock`, `data`, and `type`.
   ◦ Explored how capacity defines cell size and value, while lock and type scripts control its logic.
 
  ■ Ownership & Locks:

  ◦ Studied how cells are protected by 'lock scripts' that require 'valid digital signatures' for spending.
  ◦ Understood the 'secp256k1' lock mechanism and how ownership is verified through signatures.
 
  ■ Transaction Structure:

  ◦ Learned the full structure including inputs, outputs, cell_deps, and witnesses.
  ◦ Reviewed [RFC 0022](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0022-transaction-structure/0022-transaction-structure.md) for a deeper understanding of transaction elements.

  ■ Lock vs Type Scripts:

  ◦ Understood how Lock Scripts define ownership and validation, while Type Scripts define transformation and logic.
  ◦ Explored examples of default lock scripts and how optional type scripts enable smart contract behavior.

  ■ Key Learnings:

  ◦ Gained a solid understanding of how CKB’s Cell Model forms the foundation of all transactions.
  ◦ Learned how locks secure ownership, ensuring that only authorized users can unlock and spend cells.
  ◦ Understood the difference between Lock and Type Scripts, and how they separate authentication from business logic.
  ◦ Learned the transaction flow: how inputs are consumed, outputs are created, and dependencies are verified through cell_deps.

  ■ Practical Progress:

  ◦  Set up and explored the CKB Testnet Explorer to analyze real transaction structures.
  ◦  Studied several example transactions and observed how lock and type scripts are executed.
  ◦  Created a small reference diagram of cell and transaction flow to visualize CKB’s model.
  ◦  Practiced identifying `inputs`, `outputs`, and `witnesses` in real transactions.

  ■ Environment:

  ◦ Accessed the [CKB Documentation](https://docs.nervos.org/) for in-depth study.
  ◦ Used CKB Testnet Explorer for transaction visualization.
  ◦ Prepared local notes and diagrams for future development setup (planned for Week 2).
  ◦ Ensured system readiness for CKB node installation and CLI usage next week.
